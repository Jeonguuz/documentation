# Requests

We always try to adjust our infrastructure to keep up with increase in load automatically.

But if you know you are going to have a large increase in requests above the normal, please give us notice, as we might need to pre-warm our Loadbalancers to match the requests, and make sure our security systems won't mark it as a DDoS attack. Examples can be scheduled events, tv appearance etc.

Besides scaling your application through the Toolbox, please give us notice by sending an E-mail to:

`support@vapor.cloud`

With at least the following information:

**Subject:** Increased requests for: **[Application slug]**

- Environment
- Domains (If custom domain) the requests will be directed at
- Date and time frame for the event
- Expected requests during the time frame
- Reason for increase

This will help prevent your application from timeouts during the course of the event.
