# General

## Type

If you create your .vcloud.yml file, you need to set a type. Types right
now are:

- vapor (See more under `Vapor`

- blank (See more under `Blank`)

## Force HTTPS

If you want your project to force users on https setup:
```
force_tls: true
```

*IMPORTANT* this will make a 301 (permanent) redirect from http to https
