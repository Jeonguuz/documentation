# Introduction to .vcloud.yml

The .vcloud.yml file gives you the possibility to customize the
deployment behavior.

## Setting up the .vcloud.yml

Add a file in your project root called:

`.vcloud.yml`

And setup all information in that file. Our systems will automatically
detect the file and parse it.
