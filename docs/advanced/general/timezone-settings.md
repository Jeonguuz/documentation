# Timzone settings

Our servers are configured to always use a global timezone, this is to simplify the use of our systems.

This means, you need to take the Timezone into account when running cronjobs, writing date to database etc.

## Settings

| Location      | Timezone |
| ------------- |:--------:|
| Europe        | UTC |
