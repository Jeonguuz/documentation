# Your responsibilities

As a developer you have some responsibilities to ensure your application.

## SSL/TLS

Make sure to encrypt the connection to your application when possible. All `*.vapor.cloud` domains automatically have a certificate. If you use your own domain, we provide a free and easy system to attach a certificate to your domain, with only one command you are running with HTTPS on your domain.

Our servers are configured for highest security when it comes to SSL/TLS.

**Enabled SSL/TLS versions**

We have enabled the following versions:

- TLSv1
- TLSv1.1
- TLSv1.2

The following is disabled, because they are found insecure:

- SSLv1
- SSLv2
- SSLv3

All domains with HTTPS on our servers score an *A+* rating in ssllabs.com test.

## Access to Vapor Cloud
