# Executable

Our systems will automatically try to find your Executable. If it can't be found, or there are multiple possibilities (rare cases) it is possible to overwrite it manually.

In your cloud.yml file add the following:

```
executable: "MyProject"
```

`MyProject` is the name of your executable
